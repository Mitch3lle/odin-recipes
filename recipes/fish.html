    <h2>A delight from the lake side</h2>
    <p>
        I was never a huge fan of fish growing up. My mother prefers fish fillet and so learning to eat fish off the bone was a skill I acquired a lot later on in my life. 
        While I am not at the clean-bone status yet, I feel i leave a lot less fish on the bone now. This recipe is one of those I have absolutely no issues having, the fish turns out so crispy yet soft and
         moist inside, a real treat. I love serving whole fried fish with a tangy onion based side sauce that really makes my heart sing

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 small/medium fish</li>
         <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1 tsp chilli powder</li>
           <li>3 onions</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic; crushed</li>
             <li>1/2 cup Soy sauce</li>
             <li> tbsp tamarind paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
          Score both sides of the fish this gives you extra crispy bits
        </li>
        <li>Add cooking oil into a large pan</li>
         <li>Heat the oil and add your whole fish</li>
          <li>Fry for 4 min then gently turn the fish over</li>
           <li>Cook the other side for 4 min as well</li>
            <li>If you have a metal rack, place the fish on it to drain off any excess oil.</li>

    </ol>
