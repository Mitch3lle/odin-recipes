# Odin Recipes

This is my first HTML project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Purpose

The goal is to build a simple recipe website using only basic HTML. This project demonstrates my understanding of:

- HTML structure and elements
- Linking between pages
- Using images
- Organizing files and folders
- Version control with Git
